# Use JavaScript in extensions

## Embed JavaScript libraries in extensions

Use or build a UMD library
Add a function for an action to declare the library
Assign it to gdjs
Call the action at 1st scene and at object creation

## Wrap JavaScript libraries in events functions

Get parameter values
Return a value
When to use a behavior
Get an object behavior
Get a property value
Declare expressions rather than setting properties from JavaScript

Add a state on a scene or on object

## Use the power of both events and JavaScript

When to use one or another
- events to use the engine features
- JS for code independent from GDeveop or impossible to do with events

Add code for the warping in the library event
Add logic with events using the wrapped library
Don't use event variables from JavaScript unless necessary (structures...)

## Learn by reading code from the community

Extensions can be implemented with events and JavaScript or a mix of both. Looking at existing extensions can help a lot to understand the API or how the extension system works.

This is a few instances of extensions that use JavaScript:

* The [Noise generator](/gdevelop5/extensions/noise/) extension uses a noise library and exposes its features through expressions, action and conditions.
* The [3D object shake](/gdevelop5/extensions/shake-object3d/) extension uses the same noise library from the above extension but exposes a behavior that makes 3D objects shake.
* The [Curved movement](/gdevelop5/extensions/curved-movement/details/) extension evaluates BÃ©zier curves using JavaScript and handles movement logics with events.
* The [Boids movement](/gdevelop5/extensions/boids-movement/) extension exposes a behavior to users and uses a R-Tree internally to quickly check neighbors.
* The [Object stack](/gdevelop5/extensions/object-stack/) extension exposes conditions that pick object instances according to their position in a stack.
* The [Clipboard](/gdevelop5/extensions/clipboard/) extension uses an asynchronous web API and implements fallbacks to Electron API or Cordova plugins.
